1 Logical Operators:
    Logical operators allow us to combine multiple conditions.
    work with boolean(ture,false) values. there are three logical operators
    1) ! , || , &&
why should we use logical operators:
    1) the can greatly simplify the logic.
    2) it helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write.
NOT(!):
    it reverses the conditions. if something is true it will make it false if something is false it will make it true
    system.out.println(!true) ==> false
    system.out.println(!true)==> false
logical Or Operator(||):
     it combines two or more conditions and returns true as long as their is one
     condition is true. if all the conditions becomes false it returns us a false.
 Logical AND(&&):
     It can also combine two or more conditions. it only returns true if all the condtions
     are true.
