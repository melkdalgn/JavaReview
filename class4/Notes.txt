Operators:
     Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtraction we can compare things if we entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.
     There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators, Relational operators and logical operators.
 Arithmetic operators:
      we use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like additions, subtraction ect.
      + => Addition
      - => Subtraction
      / => Division
      * => Multiplication
      % => modules, reminder

  Relational operators.
     Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. For example if something is bigger than other
     thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
     == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we get false.
     != => used to check if two variables don't contain the same value. We get a true if they are not same.
     > =>  used to check if one value is greater than other value. We get a true if they are nit the same.
     < =>  used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will get a tru.
     >= => if the values on left side is greater than the value on right side or if they are same we will get a true.
     <= => it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing
Conditional constructs
     Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute used based on a condition.
     If condition is true that java execute the code otherwise it skips that code.
     How to write False conditions:
         if(conditions){
         any line of code even other if condition

         if(){

         }
         }
     Important Notes:
         1)For String we use method instead of === sign because it's a non-primitive data type
         2) We can cmd+opt=l(Mac) ctrl+alt+(windosw) to format our code.
         3) if we are confused about brackets we can click an opening or closing part to check to other part.
